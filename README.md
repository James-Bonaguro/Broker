# Broker

## What this is

This repository contains examples of **broker-grade internal work product** designed to reduce friction in complex commercial P&C accounts — particularly construction and renewable energy risks (solar EPCs, developers, GC/subs).

The focus is not software, automation, or client-facing tools.

The focus is:
- compressing senior broker judgment
- standardizing “what good looks like”
- removing cognitive load from high-friction workflows

The artifacts here are the kinds of documents senior brokers already create — just produced faster, more consistently, and with fewer downstream issues.

## What this is NOT

- Not a SaaS product
- Not underwriting automation
- Not carrier-side tooling
- Not legal advice
- Not client-facing deliverables
- Not “AI replacing brokers”

All outputs assume:
- human review
- broker judgment
- compliance and E&O awareness

## Core use cases

The artifacts in this repo map to real brokerage workflows:

- Underwriter-ready submissions
- Contract insurance exhibit scorecards
- Coverage delta (expiring vs renewal) summaries
- Internal stewardship and decision support

These are used to:
- anticipate underwriting objections
- surface uninsurable contract language early
- reduce rework and follow-ups
- improve placement quality and renewal outcomes

## Why this matters

In large brokerages, the constraint is not knowledge.
It’s time, attention, and judgment bandwidth.

These artifacts demonstrate how senior-level thinking can be:
- made repeatable
- shared across teams
- applied earlier in the account lifecycle

## How this is used in practice

Typically deployed as:
- internal support on complex accounts
- project-based artifact creation
- workflow standardization for high-risk segments

Always broker-led.
Always context-specific.
Always reviewed.

## Notes to self

This repo is a thinking space.
If it starts to look like marketing, it’s wrong.
If it helps explain or reproduce leverage, it’s right.
